Hi, I’m @jindroush,

old man with some free time in his old clumsy hands.

Mostly doing some fun, low level stuff. Some reversing, some simple tools for preservation of 8bit software etc.

Technologically, I use C++ on rudimentary level, and Perl for scripting, some assembly if ultimately needed. Everything else is for quiche eaters ;)
